    <h3>What is TDEE?</h3>
    <p>Wondering what is TDEE? TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It is the total number of calories you
        burn in a given day. </p>

    <h3>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</h3>
    <p>Basal metabolic rate refers to the number of calories your body burns each day to keep you alive. BMR does not
        include physical activity, the process of digestion, or things like walking from one room to another.</p>

    <p> Basically, BMR is the number of calories your body would expend in a 24 hour period if all you did was lay in
        bed all day long. This is the absolute bare minimum of calories it takes to ensure your survival.</p>

        <h3>What are Macros</h3>
    <p>The idea behind the macro diet is pretty simple: Instead of staying under a calorie threshold, you focus on
        getting a certain number (typically grams) of macronutrients—protein, carbohydrates, and fat—instead. Depending
        on your goals, you can adjust the amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fats you consume to slim down, build
        muscle, or maintain your weight.</p>

        <h3>For Example:</h3>
        <p>
            Carbohydrates: Healthy carbs typically contain lots of fiber, including whole grains, legumes, leafy greens, potatoes, and fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proteins: Good picks for healthy, lean proteins: chicken, turkey grass-fed beef, fatty fish (like salmon and mackerel), eggs, and plant-based options like beans and chickpeas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fats: Satiating, healthy fats include olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds.
